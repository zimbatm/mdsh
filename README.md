# $ mdsh # markdown shell pre-processor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zimbatm/mdsh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zimbatm/mdsh) [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/mdsh.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/mdsh)

the mdsh project describes a Markdown language extension that can be used to
automate some common tasks. The goal is to keep the syntax compatible while
allowing a pre-processor (`mdsh`) to be run against the file.

Quite often I find myself needing to embed a snippet of code or markdown from
a different file. But GitHub doesn't allow loading other files, even when
selecting a format that supports it (like AsciiDoc).

Another quite common use-case is to embed the output of a command as a fenced
code block or markdown content. For example the project is a CLI and the
`--help` output could be displayed in the README.md.

Both of these cases are supported by extending the existing syntax and running
`mdsh` against the file.

## Usage

`$ mdsh --help`
```
mdsh 0.1.3
zimbatm <zimbatm@zimbatm.com>
Markdown shell pre-processor. Never let your READMEs and tutorials get out of sync again.

Exits non-zero if a sub-command failed.

USAGE:
    mdsh [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --clean      
            Remove all generated blocks.

        --frozen     
            Fail if the output is different from the input. Useful for CI.
            
            Using `--frozen`, you can guarantee that developers update documentation when they make a change. Just add
            `mdsh --frozen` as a check to your continuous integration setup.
    -h, --help       
            Prints help information

    -V, --version    
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
    -i, --input <input>          
            Path to the markdown file. `-` for stdin. [default: ./README.md]

    -o, --output <output>        
            Path to the output file, `-` for stdout [defaults to updating the input file in-place].

        --work_dir <work_dir>    
            Directory to execute the scripts under [defaults to the input fileâ€™s directory].

```
## Syntax Extensions

### Inline Shell Code

Syntax regexp:
```regexp
^`[$>] ([^`]+)`\s*$
```

Inline Shell Code are normal `inline code` that:

* start at the beginning of a line
* include either `$` or `>` at the beginning of their content
* contain a shell command

When those are enountered, the command is executed by `mdsh` and output as
either a fenced code block (`$`) or markdown code (`>`).

* `$` runs the command and outputs a code block
* `>` runs the command and outputs markdown

Examples:

~~~
`$ seq 4 | sort -r`
```
4
3
2
1
```
~~~

~~~
`> echo 'I *can* include markdown. <code>Hehe</code>.'`
<!-- BEGIN mdsh -->
I *can* include markdown. <code>Hehe</code>.
<!-- END mdsh -->
~~~

### Link Includes

Syntax regexp:
```regexp
^\[[$>] ([^\]]+)]\([^\)]+\)\s*$
```

Link Includes work similarily to code blocks but with the link syntax.

* `$` loads the file and embeds it as a code block
* `>` loads the file and embeds it as markdown

Examples:

~~~
[$ code.rb](code.rb)
```
require "pp"

pp ({ foo: 3 })
```
~~~

~~~
[> example.md](example.md)
<!-- BEGIN mdsh -->
*this is part of the example.md file*
<!-- END mdsh -->
~~~

## Installation

The best way to install `mdsh` is with the rust tool cargo.

```bash
cargo install mdsh
```

If you are lucky enough to be a nix user:

```bash
nix-env -f https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/master.tar.gz -iA mdsh
```

## Known issues

The tool currently lacks in precision as it doesn't parse the Markdown file,
it just looks for the desired blocks by regexp. It means that in some cases it
might misintepret some of the commands. Most existing Markdown parsers are
used to generate HTML in the end and are thus not position-preserving. Eg:
pulldown-cmark

The block removal algorithm doesn't support output that contains triple
backtick or `<!-- END mdsh -->`.

## Related projects

* http://chriswarbo.net/essays/activecode/ is the closest to this project. It
  has some interesting Pandoc filters that capture code blocks into outputs.
  The transformation is not in-place like `mdsh`.
* [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
  is the practice of interspesing executable code into documents. There are
  many language-specific implementations out there. `mdsh` is a bit like a
  bash literate programming language.
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) is a whole other universe of
  documentation and code. It's great but stores the notebooks as JSON files. A
  special viewer program is required to render them to HTML or text.
