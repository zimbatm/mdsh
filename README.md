# `$ mdsh` - a markdown shell pre-processor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zimbatm/mdsh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zimbatm/mdsh) [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/mdsh.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/mdsh)

The mdsh project describes a Markdown language extension that can be used to
automate some common tasks in README.md files. Quite often I find myself
needing to embed a snippet of code or markdown from a different file. Or I
want to show the output of a command. In both cases this can be done manually,
but what all you had to do was run `mdsh` and have the file updated
automatically?

So the goal of this tool is first to extend the syntax of Markdown in a
natural way. Something that you might type. And if the `mdsh` tool is run, the
related blocks get updated in place. Most other tools would produce a new file
but we really want a sort of idempotent operation here.

In the end this gives a tool that is a bit akin to literate programming or
jupyer notebooks but for shell commands. It adds a bit of verbosity to the
file and in exchange it allows to automate the refresh of those outputs.

## Usage

`$ mdsh --help`
```
mdsh 0.4.0
zimbatm <zimbatm@zimbatm.com>
Markdown shell pre-processor. Never let your READMEs and tutorials get out of sync again.

Exits non-zero if a sub-command failed.

USAGE:
    mdsh [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --clean      
            Remove all generated blocks.

        --frozen     
            Fail if the output is different from the input. Useful for CI.
            
            Using `--frozen`, you can guarantee that developers update documentation when they make a change. Just add
            `mdsh --frozen` as a check to your continuous integration setup.
    -h, --help       
            Prints help information

    -V, --version    
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
    -i, --input <input>          
            Path to the markdown file. `-` for stdin. [default: ./README.md]

    -o, --output <output>        
            Path to the output file, `-` for stdout [defaults to updating the input file in-place].

        --work_dir <work_dir>    
            Directory to execute the scripts under [defaults to the input fileâ€™s directory].

```

## Syntax Extensions

### Inline Shell Code

Syntax regexp:
```regexp
^`[$>] ([^`]+)`\s*$
```

Inline Shell Code are normal `inline code` that:

* start at the beginning of a line
* include either `$` or `>` at the beginning of their content
* contain a shell command

When those are enountered, the command is executed by `mdsh` and output as
either a fenced code block (`$`) or markdown code (`>`).

* `$` runs the command and outputs a code block
* `>` runs the command and outputs markdown

Examples:

~~~
`$ seq 4 | sort -r`
```
4
3
2
1
```
~~~

~~~
`> echo 'I *can* include markdown. <code>Hehe</code>.'`
<!-- BEGIN mdsh -->
I *can* include markdown. <code>Hehe</code>.
<!-- END mdsh -->
~~~

### Variables

Syntax regexp:
```regexp
^`! ([\w_]+)=([^`]+)`\s*$
```

Variables allow you to set new variables in the environment and reachable by
the next blocks that are being executed.

The value part is being evaluated by bash and can thus spawn sub-shells.

Examples:

`! user=bob`

Now the $user environment variable is available:

`$ echo hello $user`
```
hello bob
```

Now capitalize the user

`! USER=$(echo $user | tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]')`

`$ echo hello $USER`
```
hello BOB
```

### Link Includes

Syntax regexp:
```regexp
^\[[$>] ([^\]]+)]\([^\)]+\)\s*$
```

Link Includes work similarily to code blocks but with the link syntax.

* `$` loads the file and embeds it as a code block
* `>` loads the file and embeds it as markdown

Examples:

~~~
[$ code.rb](samples/code.rb) as ruby
```ruby
require "pp"

pp ({ foo: 3 })
```
~~~

~~~
[> example.md](samples/example.md)
<!-- BEGIN mdsh -->
*this is part of the example.md file*
<!-- END mdsh -->
~~~

### ANSI escapes

ANSI escape sequences are filtered from command outputs:

`$ ls --color | sort | grep -v target`
```
samples
src
ci.sh
Cargo.lock
Cargo.toml
CHANGELOG.md
_config.yml
flake.lock
flake.nix
LICENSE
README.md
shell.nix
```

### Commented-out commands

Sometimes it's useful not to render the command that is being shown. All the
commands support being hidden inside of a HTML comment like so:

~~~
<!-- `$ echo example` -->
```
example
```
~~~

### Fenced code type

If you want GitHub to highlight the outputted code fences, it's possible to
postfix the line with `as <type>`. For example:

~~~
`$ echo '{ key: "value" }'` as json
```json
{ key: "value" }
```
~~~

## Installation

The best way to install `mdsh` is with the rust tool cargo.

```bash
cargo install mdsh
```

If you are lucky enough to be a nix user:

```bash
nix-env -f https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/master.tar.gz -iA mdsh
```

### Pre-commit hook

This project can also be installed as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
hook.

Add to your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/zimbatm/mdsh.git
    rev: master
    hooks:
    -   id: mdsh
```

Make sure to have rust available in your environment.

Then run `pre-commit install-hooks`

## Known issues

The tool currently lacks in precision as it doesn't parse the Markdown file,
it just looks for the desired blocks by regexp. It means that in some cases it
might misintepret some of the commands. Most existing Markdown parsers are
used to generate HTML in the end and are thus not position-preserving. Eg:
pulldown-cmark

The block removal algorithm doesn't support output that contains triple
backtick or `<!-- END mdsh -->`.

## Related projects

* <http://chriswarbo.net/essays/activecode/> is the closest to this project. It
  has some interesting Pandoc filters that capture code blocks into outputs.
  The transformation is not in-place like `mdsh`.
* [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
  is the practice of interspesing executable code into documents. There are
  many language-specific implementations out there. `mdsh` is a bit like a
  bash literate programming language.
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) is a whole other universe of
  documentation and code. It's great but stores the notebooks as JSON files. A
  special viewer program is required to render them to HTML or text.
